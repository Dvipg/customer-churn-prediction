## ðŸš€ Project Overview
Customer churn is a critical challenge for subscription-based businesses.  
This project predicts which customers are most likely to churn, enabling proactive retention strategies.

We built, evaluated, and improved multiple models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost) and generated actionable business insights.

## ðŸ’¡ Key Insights
- High **MonthlyCharges** + Low **Tenure** â†’ High churn probability.
- Customers paying via **Electronic Check** churn more often.
- Customers with fewer additional services are more likely to leave.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Recommendations
- Offer **loyalty discounts** to new customers within the first 3 months.
- Encourage **auto-payment options** with incentives.
- Bundle additional services to improve retention.
